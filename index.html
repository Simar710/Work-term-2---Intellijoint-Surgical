                    <p>Working as a software test co-op at Intellijoint Surgical was a great experience. I was exposed
                        to a wide range of technologies and processes and had the opportunity to learn a lot. I worked
                        on several projects, including developing automated tests for the software, working with the
                        development team to ensure the software was bug-free, and creating test cases for the software.
                        I also had the chance to work with the clinical teams to ensure the software met their
                        requirements.

                        My role was to ensure the software was of the highest quality and that it met the standards set
                        out by the company. In order to do this, I had to develop a comprehensive set of tests for the
                        software. I was able to use my experience in software engineering to develop test cases that
                        were effective and thorough. I also had to work with the development team to ensure that the
                        software was bug-free. I had to use my debugging and troubleshooting skills to identify and fix
                        any issues that were found.

                        Overall, working at Intellijoint Surgical was a great experience. I was able to gain a lot of
                        knowledge and experience in software testing, and I was able to apply it to real-world problems.
                        Additionally, I was able to work with a great team

                Intellijoint Surgical is a Canadian medical device company that provides minimally invasive,
                patient-specific joint replacement surgery. It manufactures and markets surgical navigation systems that
                enable orthopedic surgeons to provide precision in joint replacement surgery. The company's technology
                uses a combination of 3D imaging and advanced analytics to create a 3D model of the patient's anatomy,
                allowing the surgeon to plan, navigate, and perform the surgery with greater accuracy. The company's
                technology is designed to reduce the risk of complications associated with joint replacement surgery,
                and to improve patient outcomes.

        <p class="newclass">My experience working as a Software Test Co-op at Intellijoint Surgical was one of the most
            rewarding experiences I have had in my career. I was able to learn a lot about software testing and develop
            a wide range of skills in the process. At Intellijoint Surgical, I was responsible for performing various
            types of software tests on the company's products. These tests ranged from unit tests to integration tests
            and system tests. I was also responsible for writing test plans and test cases, as well as executing them. I
            was also involved in the development and maintenance of automated test scripts. This was done in order to
            ensure that the software was functioning properly and that the tests were being performed accurately. I was
            also responsible for creating and maintaining test databases, as well as reporting any issues that were
            encountered during the testing process. Overall, my experience at Intellijoint Surgical was extremely
            valuable. I was able to gain a great deal of knowledge and experience that I can use in future positions. I
            am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a great team and to be a part of a successful
            organization.</p>
